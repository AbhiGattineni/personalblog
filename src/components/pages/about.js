My name is Abhishek Gattineni I’m a software engineer specializing in building (and occasionally designing) exceptional digital experiences. Currently, pursuing masters in Computer Science at California State University Long Beach.</div>
                <div className="text-small text-left my-3">I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2016 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!</div>
                <div className="text-small text-left my-3">Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.</div>
